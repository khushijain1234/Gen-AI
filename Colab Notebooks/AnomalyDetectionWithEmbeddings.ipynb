On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts  were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer , Dust Detector , and Magnetometer\\n instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio  test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control  test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1  over DSS-63  and DSS-61 , respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN \\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 .  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN .  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN  to 138 DN  and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN .  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\n           off-sun  and 5 degrees off-earth \\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km \\n\\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km \\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\nprocess. The only command activity was a command to reset the command loss\\ntimer.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | \\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 11,\n        \"max\": 14,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12,\n          14,\n          11\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Class Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sci.electronics\",\n          \"sci.space\",\n          \"sci.crypt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train['Class Name'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"O7QlJzuszGbq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714460435903,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":413,"user":{"displayName":"Khushi Jain","userId":"00733239637147803182"}},"outputId":"fff96ff5-81d6-44ea-c9d9-8c84cfeb6973"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Class Name\n","sci.crypt          150\n","sci.electronics    150\n","sci.med            150\n","sci.space          150\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lXUecoMnzh4D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
